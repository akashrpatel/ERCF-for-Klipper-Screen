This project was born from a need, the need to control certain functions of the ERCF directly from klipper screen and not having to use a web browswer
This is not entirly my work, as KDE-47 In the ERCF_Questions channel on the voron discord ((https://discord.com/channels/460117602945990666/909743915475816458)) was the one that did most of the inital scripting, I just cleaned things up a bit and created the custom icons 


instructions:

copy the contents of the images folder to /KlipperScreen/styles/""name of klipper screen them you are using""/images
copy the contents from the KlipperScreen.conf and add to the top portion of your KlipperScreen.conf file
if you are using more than 9 tools, you will need to uncomment out the sections noted, ive set it up for 12, if you are using more than that, you can create
more using the same format, I have included ercfextruder.svg files for up to 15 tool heads more than that and you ron your own.

restart klipper. and enjoy.
